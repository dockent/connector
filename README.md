**Dockent Connector**
===

Component for Docker Engine API requests. Work with API **v1.32** 

Resources classes generated by [jane/open-api](https://packagist.org/packages/jane/open-api), but deserialize ability 
have been removed because part of generated Normalizers throw some exceptions. 

So, if you would update library to new API version you should check all requests and fix it, if necessary


Update flow:
---
1. Update swagger.json file
2. Run 'composer generate' command
3. Check all requests
4. Fix, if it's necessary, classes in OpenAPI namespace
5. Contribute it :)



**P.S.**

You can find edited methods by **_@edited_** annotation in PHPDoc
